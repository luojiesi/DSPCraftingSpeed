# Crafting Speed Mod
This mod lets you control the crafting speed for assemblers, from 1% to 100%. It's useful to help you design product lines for buildings. All buildings can be produced at the same time now.
* It won't let you go faster than 100%. That's by design. There are lots of other mods that do this.
* Once you install the mod, you will see the giant slider in the assembler window. That's the limit of my UI skills unfortunately.
* The updated speed settings are not included in blueprints, yet. The feature is on my TODO list once Kremnev8 adds support for storing customized information in blueprint files.
